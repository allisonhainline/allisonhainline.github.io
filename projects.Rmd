Sometimes I like to do projects and then post them on the internet for the whole world to benefit!
here's some examples. 

## stuff

- An RMarkdown presentation on the common mistakes made in visualization and how to fix them.
- Includes a github repo for access to all the code.
- Look at how high quality my work is, hire and or collaborate with me. 

## things

- Interactive plots of things
- I can code!
